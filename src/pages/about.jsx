        <p>
        <span className="font-semibold text-lg text-white">Hii there!</span>  A self-taught front-end developer with a passion for blockchain technology, Ethereum, and Web3 integration. Armed with determination and a thirst for knowledge, I've honed my skills in React, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript, and Redux to become a versatile developer ready to take on any challenge.

My journey into the world of web development began as a self-taught programmer driven by curiosity and a desire to create meaningful solutions. Guided by online resources, tutorials, and countless hours of hands-on practice, I've traversed the intricate landscape of coding, diving deep into blockchain development to explore its limitless possibilities.
